This a simple Shell project made for our process of learning in the Holberton School. This Shell include some of characteristics basics of one Shell UNIX. The Shell works interpreting the commands written in the standard input, that the user execute using its keyboard.


Clone this repo in your terminal:

Compile with: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh

Run in interactively mode with: ./hsh

when the program starts, we will see "$" symbol, for represent a “simulation” of the original Shell

Syntax overview:

The syntax is same that the Shell, so first are written the commands and them the arguments

Example:

ls –l
